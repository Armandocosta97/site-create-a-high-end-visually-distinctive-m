# CURRENT TASK EXECUTION PROMPT

You are the coding executor for this project.

## Project path
site-create-a-high-end-visually-distinctive-m

## Source of truth files
- brief/original-prompt.md
- brief/brief-summary.md
- site-spec.json
- docs/DEVELOPMENT_METHOD.md
- agent/TASK_GRAPH.json
- agent/TASK_STATE.json
- agent/CURRENT_TASK_PROMPT.md

## Development method
# Development Method

All sites must follow these rules.

## Objective
- Generate production-ready static websites that are clear, stable, responsive, modular, and easy to validate.
- Prioritize correctness before visual polish.
- Prefer predictable implementation over improvisation.

## Source of Truth
- The human prompt is not the implementation source of truth.
- `site-spec.json` is the only source of truth for pages, sections, navigation, routing, and required features.
- If supported by the project architecture, `content.json` is the source of truth for copy, labels, CTA text, and contact details.
- If supported by the project architecture, `theme.json` is the source of truth for colors, typography, spacing, radius, and visual tokens.
- The implementation flow must be: `prompt -> site-spec.json -> tasks -> code`.
- Never implement pages, routes, sections, navigation items, or features that are not defined in the spec.

## Core Principles
- Build for users first: clarity, speed, and clear actions.
- Keep code modular: reusable components with clear responsibilities.
- Favor consistency over custom one-off solutions.
- Ship small, test often, improve iteratively.
- Prefer deterministic implementation over free interpretation.
- Do not invent structure outside the spec.

## Stack
- Vite
- React
- Component-based architecture

## Required Architecture
Preferred structure:

```txt
src/
  components/
  sections/
  pages/
  layout/
  data/
  assets/
  styles/
  utils/
```

### Rules
- One responsibility per component.
- No giant monolithic page files.
- Reuse shared primitives where possible.
- Avoid duplicated markup patterns across sections.
- Prefer composition over deeply nested conditional JSX.
- Keep structure, content, and styling separated where possible.

## Layout Rules
- Hero must be full width or visually dominant at the top.
- Mobile-first responsive design is mandatory.
- Primary CTA must be visible above the fold.
- Use a max content width for readability, except for intentionally full-bleed sections.
- Maintain a consistent spacing system across all sections.
- Visual hierarchy must be clear: headline -> value -> action.
- No horizontal overflow on any tested breakpoint.
- Sections must feel complete and intentional, not sparse or placeholder-like.

## Required Components
- Header
- Hero
- Sections
- Footer

## Minimum Homepage Requirements
- Every homepage must include a hero section.
- Every homepage must include at least 2 additional meaningful content sections.
- Every homepage must include at least 1 visible CTA.
- If a gallery is required by spec, it must exist and be reachable.
- If contact actions are required by spec, they must be implemented and functional.

## Component Guidelines
- One responsibility per component.
- Keep UI and business logic separated when possible.
- Use props for configuration and avoid hardcoded content inside reusable components.
- Create shared primitives for buttons, headings, cards, containers, and section wrappers.
- Prefer composition over deeply nested conditional JSX.
- Use clear component names and prop names.
- Avoid dead components and unused routes.
- Avoid excessive inline complexity.

## Content Rules
- Content must be specific, concise, user-focused, and business-relevant.
- No lorem ipsum.
- No placeholder text.
- No dummy text.
- No "coming soon" unless explicitly required by the spec.
- No empty sections.
- No empty buttons.
- No empty links.
- Use exactly one meaningful `h1` per page.
- Section headings must be descriptive.
- CTA text must be action-oriented and specific.
- Text must feel realistic for the business type.
- When supported by the architecture, text content should come from `content.json`.
- Reusable sections should accept content through props or mapped data instead of hardcoded strings.

## Gallery
- Use a grid layout.
- Use responsive columns:
  - mobile: 1
  - tablet: 2
  - desktop: 3 or more when appropriate
- Optimize images with compression, proper dimensions, and lazy loading where appropriate.
- Images must have valid sources.
- Images must not be broken.
- Informative images must have meaningful alt text.
- Decorative images may use empty alt text only when semantically appropriate.
- Do not include a gallery navigation item unless the gallery exists and is reachable.

## CTA
- There must be at least one primary CTA in the hero.
- A fixed WhatsApp button must exist only when required by the spec.
- A phone CTA should exist in the hero when relevant to the business type.
- Primary CTA text must be action-oriented and specific.
- CTA style must remain consistent across all pages and sections.
- Every CTA must resolve correctly.
- Telephone CTAs must use valid `tel:` links.
- Email CTAs must use valid `mailto:` links.
- WhatsApp CTAs must use a valid WhatsApp URL format when enabled.
- Internal CTAs must point to an existing section or route.

## Responsive Rules
- Design starts from mobile viewport first.
- No horizontal scroll on any breakpoint.
- Touch targets must be large enough on mobile.
- Fixed CTAs must not cover essential content.
- Header must remain usable on small screens.
- Hero content must remain readable on small screens.
- Text blocks must not become too wide on desktop.
- Images must scale correctly without distortion.
- Grids must collapse cleanly across breakpoints.
- Test at least these breakpoints:
  - 360px
  - 768px
  - 1024px
  - 1440px

## Navigation Integrity
- Every navigation item must point to a real existing destination.
- Do not create links for pages, routes, or sections that do not exist.
- Before considering the implementation complete, verify that every header link, footer link, CTA, and internal navigation target resolves correctly.
- For single-page sections, verify that the target section `id` exists in the rendered page.
- For multi-page navigation, verify that the route exists and renders without 404 errors.
- If the project uses HashRouter, all internal navigation must be compatible with HashRouter.
- Do not mix plain absolute paths and hash-based routes incorrectly.
- If a section or page is not implemented, remove the corresponding navigation item instead of leaving a broken link.
- Navigation should be derived from the structure defined in `site-spec.json` whenever possible.
- Navigation must not be treated as freeform UI content.

## Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML: `header`, `main`, `section`, `footer`, `nav`.
- Ensure readable color contrast.
- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible.
- Provide meaningful alt text for informative images.
- Decorative images may use empty alt text only when appropriate.
- Keep heading structure logical: `h1 -> h2 -> h3`.
- Buttons must be real buttons when they trigger actions.
- Links must be real links when they navigate.
- Avoid vague labels when the context is unclear.

## Performance
- Optimize and compress media assets.
- Prefer local or controlled assets over fragile third-party hotlinks when possible.
- Use lazy loading for below-the-fold images where appropriate.
- Minimize unnecessary re-renders in React components.
- Avoid heavy dependencies unless they add clear value.
- Keep the implementation lightweight and static-friendly.

## SEO and Content
- One clear `h1` per page.
- Descriptive page title.
- Descriptive meta description.
- Use meaningful section headings and internal links.
- Keep copy concise, scannable, and user-focused.
- Do not sacrifice usability for SEO tricks.

## Code Quality Rules
- Code must remain maintainable and readable.
- Use clear component names.
- Use clear prop names.
- Do not leave dead components in the project.
- Do not leave unused routes in the project.
- Avoid duplicated layout logic when a shared wrapper is appropriate.
- Reusable UI patterns should be extracted into shared primitives.

Preferred shared primitives:
- Button
- Container
- SectionWrapper
- HeadingBlock
- Card
- CTABlock

## Task Execution Constraints
- Modify only the files allowed for the current task.
- Respect protected files.
- Do not introduce unrelated refactors.
- Do not break previously validated functionality.
- Do not change router behavior unless the task explicitly requires it.
- Do not add speculative features.
- Each task must produce the smallest correct change that moves the project forward safely.

## Definition of Done for a Task
A task is complete only if:
- the requested feature is implemented
- the app builds successfully
- the affected UI renders correctly
- navigation remains valid
- no new console errors are introduced
- responsive behavior is not broken
- no placeholder content is left behind

A task is not complete if it only looks correct in code but is not validated in the browser.

## Quality Gates
### Technical Pass
A site passes technical validation only if:
- build succeeds
- required semantic structure exists
- no broken images
- no broken navigation
- no blocking console errors
- required core components are present

### Publishable Pass
A site passes publishable validation only if:
- content feels real and complete
- no placeholder or empty sections exist
- CTA strategy is visible and coherent
- hierarchy is clear
- layout feels intentional on mobile and desktop
- contact actions are usable
- the site does not feel unfinished

A site must not deploy unless it passes both levels.

## Quality Checklist Before Delivery
- Layout matches all required sections and CTA rules.
- Fully responsive and tested on key breakpoints.
- No console errors.
- No broken images.
- No broken navigation.
- No empty sections.
- No placeholder text.
- Hero is strong and readable.
- CTA is visible and functional.
- Contact actions work.
- Heading structure is valid.
- Page title and meta description are set.
- Lighthouse baseline checked for Performance, Accessibility, and Best Practices.
- Final pass completed for text, links, and contact actions.

## Priority Order for Decision Making
When rules conflict, apply this order:
1. source of truth correctness
2. navigation integrity
3. technical stability
4. responsive usability
5. content clarity
6. visual polish
7. implementation elegance

- Do not implement future tasks.
- Do not modify files outside the allowed list unless a truly minimal cross-file change is strictly required to preserve build integrity.
- Prefer the allowed files as the primary implementation scope.
- Keep the code modular, readable, and production-oriented.
- Follow the development method strictly.
- Respect the structured spec.
- If the original brief includes stylistic guidance not fully captured by the spec, follow the brief without violating the spec.
- Do not redesign unrelated sections.
- Do not remove already implemented valid work unless required for the current task.
- Keep routing and navigation coherent with the spec.
- Preserve compatibility with the project routing mode.

## Required completion behavior
- Implement the task.
- Run a build check.
- Update agent/AGENT_REPORT.md with a short summary of what was implemented.
- Do not manually change TASK_STATE.json.
